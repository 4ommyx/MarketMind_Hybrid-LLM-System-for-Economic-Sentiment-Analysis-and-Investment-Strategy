1,2026-01-03 09:56:10,Investing.com,BofA unveils its top 10 U.S. ideas for Q1 2026,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/bofa-unveils-its-top-10-us-ideas-for-q1-2026-4427940,"Investing.com -- Bank of America has released its new list of high-conviction U.S. stock ideas for the first quarter of 2026, featuring nine Buy-rated names and one Underperform.

The quarterly lineup highlights companies that the bank believes have “significant market and business-related catalysts in the quarter ahead,” according to BofA strategist Anthony Cassamassino.

The Buy recommendations span nine industries and include Amazon , Boeing , Cigna , Constellation Energy , Dollar General , Equinix , Merck , Spotify , and Vertex Pharmaceuticals .

The lone Underperform is homebuilder Lennar . BofA said the list is designed as a short-term set of opportunities and will be updated only at the start of each quarter unless ratings change.

While artificial intelligence remains a key theme, the bank emphasised that “the drivers for the broader list are more diverse.” BofA noted that it sees legislative developments as a potential catalyst for Cigna , while for Merck, the bank highlighted its “attractive valuation.”

Dollar General , meanwhile, could benefit from “higher-than-expected tax refunds in F1Q26.”

Amazon is the firm’s top large-cap internet stock, “given exposure to AI vs AWS,” and the bank’s “expectation for AWS revenue growth to accelerate into 2026.”

“For Boeing , we expect 1Q will focus on commercial production rates,” added BofA. “Production remaining stable is a key to investor confidence and the name building momentum for the year.”

For the wider market, BofA’s U.S. equity strategist Savita Subramanian warned that “there is no way to sugar coat it – the S&P 500 is expensive.”

Still, she pointed to Health Care, IT and Real Estate as sectors that “screen attractive near-term.”",Financials,0.0447727947881044,"{'Financials': 0.04477, 'Healthcare': 0.02544, 'Energy': 0.02501}",3,,"Financials, Healthcare, Energy",0.6,0.65,0.3,"Bank of America has unveiled its top 10 U.S. stock picks for Q1 2026, comprising nine ""Buy"" recommendations across various sectors and one ""Underperform"" rating for Lennar, with the selections driven by diverse factors including market catalysts and legislative developments."
1,2026-01-03 09:55:45,Investing.com,Canaccord’s says 2026 is likely to be ’a bountiful year for Tesla’,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/canaccords-says-2026-is-likely-to-be-a-bountiful-year-for-tesla-4428184,"Investing.com -- Canaccord Genuity analyst George Gianarikas said 2026 is shaping up to be a pivotal year for Tesla, driven by a wave of new products and a reset in the U.S. electric vehicle market that he believes ultimately favours the company.

Gianarikas said Tesla is set to benefit from the expected scale-up of its CyberCab and Optimus Gen 3 programs, alongside a potential acceleration in Semitruck production.

In the United States the expiry of federal EV subsidies has weighed on near-term demand but is forcing the market into a healthier and more durable phase. The recent weakness reflects a pause typical of major technology transitions rather than a structural reversal in EV adoption.

Gianarikas said EV demand, previously boosted by generous tax credits, is resetting into a smaller but more fundamentals-driven market. Pricing and incentives are normalising, weaker models are being phased out, and competition is increasingly favouring manufacturers with dedicated EV platforms, software and cost discipline.

Gianarikas said Tesla stands apart in the U.S. as the only automaker with a fully scaled and integrated EV franchise, with Rivian emerging as the only credible long-term mass-market challenger. He added that the current shakeout is clarifying which automakers treated EVs as core businesses rather than compliance efforts, a shift he sees as positive for Tesla’s market share.

Gianarikas pointed to rising EV adoption in emerging markets such as Thailand, Vietnam and Brazil. While these regions are not yet meaningful contributors to Tesla’s results, he said they represent early-stage opportunities for longer-term growth, even as competition from Chinese automakers intensifies.

Canaccord applies a 46x multiple to its 2028 non-GAAP earnings estimate of $11.98 a share to arrive at a price target of $551. Gianarikas said the premium valuation reflects Tesla’s long-duration growth opportunities in robotics, autonomy and energy storage. Though the implied execution leaves little room for error.

""2026 is shaping up to be a bountiful year for Tesla, with the anticipated scale-up of CyberCab and Optimus (Gen 3) production, alongside a possible acceleration in Semi output and continued expansion in energy storage driven by the launch of Megapack 3.

1,2026-01-03 09:05:02,Investing.com,Is Reddit the new homepage for the Open Web?,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/is-reddit-the-new-homepage-for-the-open-web-4425436,"Investing.com -- Reddit is increasingly positioned as a key beneficiary of the shift from traditional search toward AI-generated answers, according to a recent analysis by brokerage Needham.

As search queries are replaced by AI answers, economic value is moving away from links and toward the sources cited by large language models (LLMs).

In that context, Needham analyst Laura Martin says Reddit is emerging as “the new homepage for the Open Internet,” given its outsized presence in AI citations and growing role in consumer discovery.

The core change that Martin highlights is the move from link-based search results to AI answers that summarize information directly.

As AI answers – responses generated directly by LLMs such as ChatGPT and Google’s AI Overviews – replace links, overall referral traffic declines, but the value shifts to the sources cited within those responses.

The analyst points to multiple studies suggesting Reddit accounts for a disproportionate share of those citations, consistently representing between 20% and 40% of sources referenced by AI-generated answers.

“As AI-Answers replace links, economic benefits shift to the citations that AI-Answers give, and 20%-40% of citations are to Reddit,” Martin said.

This citation dominance is supported by several third-party studies cited in the note. A July 2025 Pew study found a meaningful gap in click behavior between searches with and without AI summaries, reinforcing the idea that reduced clicks increase the importance of citation ownership.

A large-scale Semrush study published in the fourth quarter of 2025 analyzed 230,000 prompts across major AI platforms and found that Reddit appeared in roughly 40% of AI-generated responses.

By comparison, Wikipedia and YouTube trailed with citation rates of 26.3% and 23.5%, respectively.

Ironically, Semrush said that AI models favor Reddit because it offers “real, human responses, from users with experience in related fields.”

Martin also points out similar findings from Axios and Similarweb. Axios data showed Reddit was a top-cited platform across all major language models, while Similarweb observed rising “zero-click” behavior as Google’s AI overviews expanded, alongside heavy citation of Reddit.

From a business perspective, Needham sees two key economic benefits for Reddit from this shift.

The first is data licensing, with the firm estimating more than $120 million per year in license fees from large language model providers, a figure it believes could double once ongoing litigation with other AI firms is resolved.

The second is advertising upside, as increased visibility through AI citations drives impressions and engagement.

“Bottom line, RDDT is disproportionately cited inside AI-Answers (up to 40% of citations) and citations are the new value driver for consumer discovery and navigation of the Open Internet,” Martin concluded.",Technology,0.0324551182245956,{'Technology': 0.03246},1,,Technology,0.85,0.83,0.85,"Needham analyst Laura Martin suggests that Reddit is becoming ""the new homepage for the Open Internet"" as AI-driven responses increasingly cite the platform, shifting economic value from traditional search links to content sources like Reddit."

In an order released by the White House, Trump said HieFo was ""controlled by a citizen of the People’s Republic of China"" and that its 2024 acquisition of Emcore’s businesses led the president to believe that it may ""take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States.""

The order did not name the individual or detail Trump’s concerns.

""The Transaction is hereby prohibited,"" Trump said, ordering HieFo to ""divest all interests and rights in the Emcore Assets, wherever located,"" within 180 days.

The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States identified a national security risk in its investigation of the deal, the Treasury Department said after Trump’s order. The statement did not specify the national security risk.

HieFo and Emcore could not immediately be reached for comment and had not posted any reaction on their websites as of late on Friday.

Emcore, publicly traded at the time of the deal and later taken private, has said HieFo bought its chips business and indium-phosphide wafer-fabrication operations for $2.92 million.

By Nell Mackenzie, Ateev Bhandari and Anirban Sen

NEW YORK, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Large multi-manager funds, including D.E. Shaw, Balyasny Asset Management, Bridgewater Associates and Point72 Asset Management, generated mostly double-digit gains in 2025, reflecting an upbeat year for the hedge fund industry that was buoyed by an AI-powered stock market rally.

D.E. Shaw’s two flagship funds produced double-digit returns, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday, reflecting similar gains seen across top multi-strategy peers during a year of record volatility.

The firm’s Oculus Fund generated a net return of around 28.2% for the year and has made a net annualized return of 14.4% since its founding in 2004, the source said.

D.E. Shaw’s Composite Fund, which is its largest multi-strategy fund, generated a net return of around 18.5%, with an annualized net return of 12.9% since its inception in 2001, the person said.

Founded in 1988, D.E. Shaw managed more than $85 billion as of December 1 across hedge funds, private markets, multi-asset-class and active equity investment strategies.

Balyasny, which was co-founded in 2001 by Dmitry Balyasny, delivered gains of 16.7% during the year, while Steve Cohen’s Point72 produced a return of 17.5%, according to two people familiar with the matter.

Top multi-manager funds broadly enjoyed healthy gains last year, helped mainly by a strong performance from the U.S. stock market that has been lifted by euphoria around artificial intelligence-focused stocks.

Fund managers also have benefited from U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade wars that triggered volatility in bond and currency markets. Large global macro hedge funds typically invest in stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities.

""Overall, it has been a strong year for hedge funds across strategies, with decent alpha generation and recognition from allocators,"" said Vanessa Bogaardt, global head of capital introduction, prime financing at Bank of America.

""Hedge fund assets are at all-time highs, supported by net inflows into the industry. Allocator sentiment toward hedge funds remains positive, and we see plenty of opportunities to explore in 2026,” she added.

The benchmark S&P 500 index rose about 16% last year, as it went from record highs in mid-February, to near bear-market lows in early April, and then to fresh record highs in December.

The volatility - fueled largely by Trump’s whiplash trade, fiscal and geopolitical policies - helped trading desks across Wall Street reap profits, as active portfolio shuffling created price arbitrage.

Bridgewater Associates, founded by billionaire Ray Dalio and currently led by CEO Nir Bar Dea, posted the highest profits in its 50-year history. Its flagship Pure Alpha fund surged 34% in 2025 to lead the pack of top multi-strategy funds that operate so-called pod shops, which refer to teams of traders who oversee multiple asset classes including stocks, commodities, and bonds.

Billionaire investor Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management made annual gains of 19.6% in its multi-strategy Apex Strategy and 18.6% in its alternative trend-following Helix Strategy, another source told Reuters on Friday.

Some top firms including Millennium and Citadel, however, lagged their largest peers, after being weighed down during the first half of the year by Trump administration trade policies.

Millennium gained 10.5% during the year, while Citadel’s flagship Wellington fund posted a 10.2% return, according to two sources familiar with the matter. Citadel’s long-term annualized net return since its inception in 1990 stood at about 19%, one of the sources said.",Financials,0.1463227890257639,"{'Financials': 0.14632, 'Utilities': 0.03504}",2,,"Financials, Utilities",0.85,0.85,0.85,"Top hedge funds such as D.E.

Shares of money-losing Trump Media & Technology Group are up over 30% since December 18, when it announced a $6 billion merger with Google-backed TAE Technologies. The stock had jumped as much as 63% in the two days following the announcement.

Since the merger announcement, short interest in Trump Media shares has climbed 31% to nearly 16 million shares, around the highest level since October, S3 Partners said in a report on Friday. With the stock adding 4% on Friday to $13.77, that short interest represents bets worth about $218 million that the company’s shares will decline.

Trump Media’s all-stock deal is an ambitious bet on the power boom spurred by artificial intelligence data centers and adds to the Trump family’s growing roster of diverse ventures, from cryptocurrency to real estate holdings and mobile services.

Trump has 115 million shares in Trump Media, roughly 40% of the company. His stake in the merged company would be roughly 20%.

The order prohibits the Delaware-based HieFo, which is controlled by a Chinese citizen, from completing its acquisition of ""assets comprising the digital chips and related wafer design, fabrication, and processing businesses"" of New Jersey-based Emcore.

The companies had announced in 2024 that they completed a deal worth $2.92 million for Emcore’s chips business and indium phosphide wafer fabrication operations. The transaction was finalized on April 30, 2024.

Under the executive order, HieFo must divest all interests and rights in the Emcore assets within 180 calendar days, unless extended by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS).

The order states there is ""credible evidence"" that HieFo ""might take action that threatens to impair the national security of the United States"" through the acquisition.

Until the divestment is completed, HieFo is prohibited from granting access to the Emcore assets or non-public technical information to any persons who are not HieFo personnel without CFIUS approval.

The order also requires HieFo to certify compliance weekly and permits U.S. government employees designated by CFIUS to access HieFo’s U.S. premises for verification purposes.

1,2026-01-02 21:21:29,Investing.com,Stock market today: S&P 500 ekes out gain to kick off 2026 as chip stocks shine,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/us-futures-rise-as-markets-kick-off-new-year-on-upbeat-note-4427553,"Investing.com--The S&P 500 eked out a gain Friday on the first day of the trading year, as chip stocks jumped, but broader gains were kept in check by a stumble in major tech stocks including Microsoft and Meta amid light trading volumes.

At 4:00 p.m. ET (21:00 GMT), the S&P 500 was up about 0.2%  while Nasdaq 100 closed roughly flat, but Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.7%, or 319 points.

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA ) and Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ: MU ) led the move higher in the chip stocks, rising more than 1% and 10%, respectively, but gains in the broader tech sector were kept in check by slump in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ: META ).

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA ) was also under pressure after EV maker reported that sales fell 16% in Q4 from a year earlier, weighed down by weaker demand in Europe and China. Adding to Tesla’s woes, Chinese EV maker BYD overtook Tesla to become the world’s largest seller of electric vehicles in 2025 after reporting 28% jump in sales of its battery-powered cars for 2025.

""The rebound this morning is being led by large-cap technology,"" Katie Stockton, founder of Fairlead Strategies, wrote in the morning note.

However, Stockton warns that ""a short-term overbought downturn remains active to suggest there is heightened risk in the days ahead.""

Trading conditions are expected to remain thin, with many investors yet to return from the holiday break and fuller participation unlikely until early next week. Still, strategists at Deutsche Bank cautioned against reading too much into the early move.

“We shouldn’t extrapolate too far, as the first trading day has been an incredibly poor guide in recent times to how the rest of the year plays out,” strategists including Jim Reid wrote.

Still, the forces that dominated last year, particularly enthusiasm for artificial intelligence-linked stocks that helped drive all three major U.S. indexes to record highs in 2025, are likely to feature again this year.

""Long-term relative trends still favor technology for 2026, although the intermediate-term relative trend for tech has weakened for Q1,"" Stockton added.

Strong momentum faded into year-end, however, with the S&P 500, Nasdaq and Dow all posting declines over the final four sessions of 2025. The pullback ran counter to expectations for a so-called Santa Claus rally, which typically sees stocks rise over the last five trading days of December and the first two sessions of January.

Barclays warned that equity markets could turn choppy as they enter 2026 at elevated levels that are “over reliant on AI success.”

The bank’s strategists nonetheless expect further gains over the year, citing resilient corporate earnings and a favorable balance between economic growth and monetary policy.

Looking ahead, investors see U.S. monetary policy as a key driver. Expectations of a more dovish Federal Reserve, reinforced by recent economic data and speculation around future leadership, have led markets to price in additional rate cuts, setting the tone for global assets in 2026.",Financials,0.0811610766006463,"{'Financials': 0.08116, 'Technology': 0.04998}",2,,"Financials, Technology",0.05,0.1,0.2,"The S&P 500 gained slightly on the first trading day of 2026, driven by strong performances in chip stocks like NVIDIA and Micron, despite declines in major tech companies such as Microsoft and Meta, and further pressured by Tesla's sales downturn and loss of top EV sales"
1,2026-01-02 21:16:07,Investing.com,TSX starts positive in 2026 following record-breaking year,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/tsx-set-for-positive-2026-open-following-recordbreaking-year-4427819,"Investing.com -- Canadian equities start positive at 2026, as a resurgence in the precious metals complex provides a tailwind for the resource-heavy Toronto market. Following a brief year-end retreat, investors are returning to the ""safe-haven"" trade amid a weakening U.S. dollar and escalating geopolitical friction. Index on Friday is up 170 points or 0.54% at 31,883.37. This follows a somber final session of 2025, where the S&P/TSX Composite fell 153.50 points to close at 31,712.76. Despite that late-December softness, the benchmark ended 2025 with a 28.2% annual gain, its strongest performance since 2009, outpacing the S&P 500’s 17% return.

The primary catalyst for Friday’s pre-market bounce is a broad recovery in the materials sector. After a sharp ""flush out"" in the final week of December, gold and silver have resumed their upward trajectory.

XAU/USD : Spot gold jumped 1.4% to $4,370.41/oz, while U.S. Gold Futures rose 0.9% to $4,380.30. Bullion remains supported by expectations of further Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2026 and robust buying from emerging market central banks.

Silver Futures : Climbed 4.46% to $73.75, building on a 2025 rally that saw the metal surge nearly 150% due to data center and solar energy demand.

Platinum Futures : Skyrocketed 5.07% to $2,147.85, as supply constraints continue to pinch the market.

Analysts suggest that while profit-taking characterized the end of December, the fundamental drivers, geopolitical uncertainty and a dovish Fed tilt, remain firmly in place for the new year.

S&P 500 was up about 0.2% at 3:02 p.m. ET (20:02 GMT) in New York, while Nasdaq 100 fell 0.1%. Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.7%, or 323 points. Historically, the S&P 500 has often started the year with modest losses before rallying to double-digit gains, but the 2026 opening indicates a ""risk-on"" appetite as traders bet on a soft landing for the global economy.

In a stark contrast to the metals rally, the energy sector is starting 2026 on the defensive.

Brent Oil Futures : Slipped 0.95% to $60.28.

Crude Oil WTI Futures : Fell 1% to $56.84.

Bearish sentiment is being driven by a projected market surplus and a deepening rift within OPEC+. Tensions between Saudi Arabia and the UAE over operations in Yemen have cast a shadow over the upcoming OPEC+ virtual meeting on January 4. While geopolitical risks, including fresh drone strikes on Russian energy infrastructure and U.S. sanctions on Venezuelan tankers, provide intermittent support, they have so far failed to offset the reality of rising global inventories.

As the TSX opens its first session of 2026, the focus will remain on the ""tug-of-war"" between a resurgent mining sector and a struggling energy complex. Market participants are also keeping a close eye on the U.S. dollar’s trajectory, as its continued weakness remains the secret sauce for the Canadian benchmark’s commodity-led outperformance.",Basic Materials,0.078916592283493,"{'Basic Materials': 0.07892, 'Energy': 0.06391, 'Utilities': 0.03956}",3,,"Basic Materials, Energy, Utilities",0.75,0.73,0.85,"The Toronto Stock Exchange begins 2026 positively, rising 0.54%, driven by a rebound in the precious metals sector and supported by a weakening U.S. dollar and increasing geopolitical tensions."

The clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company said it will deliver the update on Monday, January 5, 2026, at 7:00 a.m. EST. The announcement concerns GH001, the company’s lead product candidate formulated for mebufotenin administration via a proprietary inhalation approach.

1,2026-01-02 21:12:30,Reuters,Luxury retailer Saks Global CEO Marc Metrick steps down as bankruptcy looms,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/luxury-retailer-saks-global-ceo-marc-metrick-steps-down-4427927,"Jan 2 (Reuters) - Saks Global said on Friday CEO Marc Metrick has stepped down and named Executive Chairman Richard Baker as his successor, amid reports that the luxury retailer is preparing for bankruptcy.

The change at the top comes days after the Wall Street Journal reported that the Neiman Marcus parent company is preparing for bankruptcy after missing an interest payment exceeding $100 million on debt from its Neiman merger.

Saks Global was created after Saks Fifth Avenue parent Hudson’s Bay Company acquired rival Neiman Marcus, bringing together the two upmarket department store chains to control costs amid uneven demand and better compete with rivals such as Nordstrom and Macy’s Bloomingdale’s.

Metrick spent nearly 30 years with Saks, heading the luxury portfolio including Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus. He led Saks Global since its formation in July 2024 and worked on shaping the firm’s digital transformation and strategy.

""The Saks and Neiman Marcus merger has been a disaster,"" said David Swartz, department store analyst at Morningstar, adding that luxury shoppers are shifting to Bloomingdale’s, Nordstrom and brand-owned stores.

""The whole luxury multibrand space has been struggling for years.""

Products at Saks Fifth Avenue range from about $60 for cotton rib tank dresses to nearly $20,000 for designer dresses, with handbags typically priced between $100 and $38,280, according to information on its website.

Incoming CEO Baker is the owner of real estate firm NRDC and has a long track record in retail and property. He previously chaired Retail Opportunity Investments Corp and served as the president of Saks Fifth Avenue Foundation, founded in 2017.

The company said Metrick stepped down to pursue ""new opportunities"" and has not provided any further details.

1,2026-01-02 20:06:30,Reuters,Equinor challenges US order to suspend Empire Wind project,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/equinor-challenges-us-order-to-suspend-empire-wind-project-4428120,"Jan 2 (Reuters) - Norwegian energy group Equinor said on Friday it had filed a civil suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia challenging a U.S. Department of the Interior order to suspend its Empire Wind project.

""As part of that case, Empire plans to seek a preliminary injunction and allow construction to continue while the litigation proceeds,"" Equinor added.

Last week, the Trump administration suspended leases for five large offshore wind projects that are under construction off the U.S. East Coast over what it called national security concerns, sending shares of offshore wind companies plunging.

The suspension was the latest blow for offshore wind developers that have faced repeated disruptions to their multi-billion-dollar projects under U.S. President Donald Trump, who has said he finds wind turbines ugly, costly and inefficient.

Denmark’s Orsted said on Friday it was challenging the U.S. government’s suspension of the lease for its Revolution Wind joint venture and would seek a court injunction against the decision to halt its $5 billion offshore wind project.

Equinor said filing for a preliminary injunction is necessary to keep the project on track during this critical execution phase and avoid further commercial and financing impacts if the order remains in effect.

Equinor said Empire Wind is being developed under contract with New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA).

The project is more than 60% complete and represents a major investment in U.S. energy infrastructure, jobs and supply chains, the company said.",Energy,0.1805152679897234,"{'Energy': 0.18052, 'Utilities': 0.03804, 'Industrials': 0.03021}",3,,"Energy, Utilities, Industrials",0.05,0.6,-0.8,"Equinor has challenged a U.S. order to suspend its Empire Wind project by filing a civil lawsuit and seeking a preliminary injunction to continue construction, following the Trump administration's suspension of several offshore wind projects due to national security concerns."

1,2026-01-02 18:55:10,Reuters,’Top Gun: Maverick’ copyright claim against Paramount rejected by US appeals court,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/top-gun-maverick-copyright-claim-against-paramount-rejected-by-us-appeals-court-4428091,"Jan 2 (Reuters) - A federal appeals court ruled on Friday that the 2022 Tom Cruise blockbuster ""Top Gun: Maverick"" did not infringe a magazine article that inspired the original 1986 ""Top Gun"" film.

The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Pasadena, California said ""Maverick,"" from Paramount Pictures, was not substantially similar to ""Top Guns,"" a 1983 article by Ehud Yonay about the U.S. Navy’s Top Gun fighter pilot training school in San Diego.

Yonay gave Paramount rights to his article that year for the original ""Top Gun,"" and was credited in the film.

His widow Shosh Yonay and son Yuval Yonay, heirs to his copyright, terminated the license in 2020 and said they deserved some profits from ""Maverick,"" whose $1.5 billion worldwide gross is the 14th highest ever according to Box Office Mojo. ""Maverick"" is also Cruise’s highest-grossing film.

Lawyers for the Yonays did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Paramount, part of Paramount Skydance , and its lawyers did not immediately respond to similar requests.

The Yonays, both from Israel, said ""Maverick"" shared plot, character, dialogue and thematic elements with ""Top Guns,"" with both works depicting ""what it takes to be the best of the best in fighter aviation.""

The three-judge appeals court panel said ""Maverick"" contained many significant plot elements not in ""Top Guns,"" including a romantic subplot and Cruise’s character, Navy Captain Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell, returning to train younger pilots.

It also said the Yonays described both works at ""such a high level of abstraction"" that the alleged similarities were not protectable.

""Their claim of substantial similarity fails because what is protected is not similar, and what is similar is not protected,"" Circuit Judge Eric Miller wrote.

The panel added that Paramount was not required to credit Ehud Yonay in ""Maverick"" because his 1983 agreement did not cover the film.

Friday’s decision upheld an April 2024 dismissal by U.S. District Judge Percy Anderson in Los Angeles.

Paramount is also defending against a lawsuit in New York by screenwriter Shaun Gray, who said he wrote several scenes that appeared in ""Maverick"" and deserves some of its profits.

1,2026-01-02 18:48:29,Reuters,"Tesla loses EV crown to China’s BYD as competition, tax credit expiry hit demand",https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/teslas-quarterly-deliveries-fall-more-than-expected-on-lower-ev-demand-4427809,"Jan 2 (Reuters) - Tesla ceded its crown as the world’s top electric vehicle maker to China’s BYD , after annual sales fell for a second year, hit by rising competition, the expiry of U.S. tax credits and brand backlash.

With global EV sales rising 28% last year, BYD outsold Tesla for the first time on an annual basis, helped by rapid growth in Europe, where the Chinese automaker has been widening its lead over the U.S. rival.

Tesla, whose sales fell about 8.6% in 2025, is facing intense competition, especially in Europe, raising questions about its ability to revive the core auto business as CEO Elon Musk steers the company towards robotaxis and humanoid robots.

Shares of the company fell about 2% in afternoon trading.

""Investors are so focused on the future with Tesla that they are ignoring delivery numbers. It’s about Optimus, Robotaxi and physical AI,"" said Dennis Dick, a trader at Triple D Trading, which owns Tesla shares.

END OF TAX CREDIT IN U.S. PINCHES TESLA

Tesla’s fourth-quarter figures come after third-quarter deliveries were supported by a rush to lock in $7,500 in federal tax credits after President Donald Trump’s administration decided to pull the plug on the incentive in September.

In the U.S., EVs accounted for 6.2% of retail vehicle sales in the quarter, down 3.6 percentage points from a year earlier, while average transaction prices rose nearly $6,000 to $53,300, according to J.D. Power data.

Tesla said it delivered 418,227 vehicles in the October-December quarter, down 15.6% from 495,570 a year earlier. Analysts expected 434,487 vehicles, or a 12.3% drop, according to Visible Alpha.

For the full year, Tesla delivered 1.64 million vehicles, compared with 1.79 million in 2024. Analysts polled by Visible Alpha had expected deliveries of about 1.65 million vehicles.

The decline in deliveries was not a major surprise, given the market had already priced in weaker demand after U.S. EV tax credits ended, said Seth Goldstein, senior equity research analyst at Morningstar.

Meanwhile, Tesla said it deployed 14.2 GWh of energy storage products, a record high. It is set to report fourth-quarter results on January 28.

INTENSIFYING COMPETITION IN NORTH AMERICA AND EUROPE

Growing competition from Chinese and European automakers such as BYD, Volkswagen and BMW has weighed on Tesla’s sales momentum.

Tesla registrations declined across much of Europe in December but jumped in Norway, where record sales contrasted with shrinking market share in rest of the region in 2025.

BYD said sales outside of China climbed to a record 1 million vehicles in 2025, up about 150% from 2024. The company has said it aimed to sell as many as 1.6 million vehicles outside China in 2026, though it has not disclosed an overall sales target.

Tesla in October launched stripped-down ""Standard"" versions of the Model Y and Model 3, priced about $5,000 below the previous base models, as it sought to defend sales volumes after the tax credit loss and appeal to customers in Europe looking for cheaper options.

The move disappointed some investors who had expected a larger price cut or a meaningfully new mass-market product.

Even as vehicle deliveries have weakened, Tesla shares rose about 11.4% in 2025, boosting Musk’s wealth.",Financials,0.0680208020535673,"{'Financials': 0.06802, 'Consumer Cyclical': 0.0581}",2,,"Financials, Consumer Cyclical",-0.75,-0.63,-0.8,"Tesla lost its position as the world's leading electric vehicle manufacturer to China's BYD due to declining sales affected by increased competition, the expiration of U.S. tax incentives, and negative brand perception."

(NASDAQ:HOLO) stock rose 2.7% on Friday after the technology service provider announced the launch of its Q-DPC Accelerator, a new tool that leverages quantum computing technology to enhance strategy evaluation efficiency.

The Q-DPC Accelerator utilizes a quantum-enhanced density peak clustering algorithm to identify clustering structures in strategy sets, which the company says significantly reduces the complexity of strategy evaluation processes. The tool features three core functions: strategy set preprocessing, quantum clustering grouping, and intelligent strategy matching.

According to the company, the Q-DPC Accelerator can efficiently process large-scale complex strategy sets through quantum data cleaning, feature extraction, and data conversion. The quantum clustering capability evaluates density and distance relationships between strategies, dividing them into different clusters to reduce computational complexity.

The tool is designed to provide rapid matching when access requests are initiated by comparing request information with pre-generated strategy clusters. This approach reportedly improves both matching speed and accuracy while maintaining system security and compliance.

MicroCloud Hologram positions the Q-DPC Accelerator as having broad application potential across various industries, particularly in helping enterprises build security protection systems. The company expects the tool’s performance to further improve as quantum computing technology continues to develop.",Technology,0.1384334931639769,{'Technology': 0.13843},1,,Technology,0.85,0.85,0.8,"MicroCloud Hologram's stock increased by 2.7% following the announcement of their new quantum computing tool, the Q-DPC Accelerator, which aims to improve strategy evaluation efficiency through advanced clustering algorithms."
1,2026-01-02 17:30:51,Reuters,New York Mayor Mamdani vows to enact democratic socialist agenda,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/mamdanis-inauguration-new-york-new-year-new-mayor-4426330,"(Corrects paragraph 2 to add dropped word ""influence"")

NEW YORK, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Democrat Zohran Mamdani became New York City’s mayor on Thursday, vowing during a public swearing-in ceremony on the steps of City Hall to enact an aggressive agenda aimed at making the nation’s largest city more affordable for working people.

Mamdani, a member of his party’s left-wing democratic socialist faction, was elected last November in a prominent victory that could influence this year’s midterm elections that will determine control of the U.S. Congress. Some Democrats have embraced his style while Republicans portray him as a foil on the national political stage.

The 34-year-old campaigned heavily on cost-of-living issues and was sharply critical of Republican President Donald Trump, whose approval rating has fallen over the past year amid economic concerns.

Many of New York’s 8 million residents - some with hope, some with trepidation - expect him to be a disruptive political force. In a speech following his public swearing-in, Mamdani promoted core campaign promises of universal childcare, affordable rents and free bus service.

""We will answer to all New Yorkers, not to any billionaire or oligarch who thinks they can buy our democracy,"" he said. ""I was elected as a democratic socialist and I will govern as a democratic socialist.""

The program for Mamdani’s inauguration included remarks by U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders and U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, fellow democratic socialists at the vanguard of the Democratic Party’s liberal wing.

Sanders, whom Mamdani calls his inspiration, defended Mamdani’s agenda.

""Making sure that people can live in affordable housing is not radical,"" Sanders said. ""It is the right and decent thing to do.""

The crowd of several thousand cheered loudly when Sanders called on America’s millionaires and billionaires to pay more in taxes, breaking into a chant of ""tax the rich.""

Even with temperatures well below freezing, the city set up a viewing area along Broadway to allow thousands more to watch a livestream of the ceremony, which included musical performances.

Mae Hardman-Hill, 27, volunteered for Mamdani’s campaign and said it felt like his political momentum was growing.

""I’m a native New Yorker. I’ve watched the city like you just become less and less affordable, less and less livable,"" Hardman-Hill said. ""I’m really excited for ... regular people to get some power back again.""

Prior to the public ceremony, Mamdani was privately sworn in as New York City’s mayor in the first minutes of the New Year on Thursday at the historic City Hall subway station, which was decommissioned decades ago and is accessible only a few times a year through guided tours.

Reflecting his Muslim faith, he used a Quran, Islam’s holiest book, for his swearing-in, a first for a New York City mayor.

Hours after Mamdani took office, the lead group tasked with electing Republicans to the U.S. House of Representatives sought to portray him as a ""radical socialist.""

""Every time Mamdani opens his mouth or swipes his pen, he tattoos the Democrat Party’s failures onto every House Democrat facing voters in 2026,"" spokesperson Mike Marinella said in a statement that signaled the sizable role Mamdani is likely to play on the national campaign stage.

Mamdani, a former state lawmaker, promised a freeze on rents and free buses and childcare, building a campaign around affordability issues that some have seen as a path forward for the Democratic Party around the country ahead of November midterm elections.

Dean Fuleihan, the incoming deputy mayor, told the Financial Times that Mamdani will move ahead with plans to increase taxes on millionaires to pay for his campaign promises and balance New York’s budget. He added that he doesn’t expect rich people to leave the city as a result of potentially higher taxes.

New York Governor Kathy Hochul has said she opposes raising personal income taxes but is considering raising corporate taxes to pay for a potential budget shortfall amid federal cuts.

In one early reversal, Mamdani said on Wednesday that he would no longer seek to end mayoral control of New York City’s public school system, the largest in the U.S., naming veteran educator Kamar Samuels as chancellor.

Mamdani inspired a record-breaking turnout of more than 2 million voters and took 50% of the vote in November, nearly 10 points ahead of Andrew Cuomo running as an independent and well ahead of Republican Curtis Sliwa.

The Uganda-born Mamdani has been a sharp critic of Trump on issues such as immigration and said his differences with the president were numerous after a warm White House meeting.

Mamdani raised $2.6 million for the transition and celebrations from nearly 30,000 contributors, more than other mayors on record this century, both by the total and single donations, according to official campaign data that presents disclosures of inaugural expenses beginning with Michael Bloomberg’s first term in 2001.

As mayor, Mamdani will move from his one-bedroom Astoria apartment, protected from sharp price hikes by the city rent-stabilization program, to Gracie Mansion, the official residence of New York City mayors on Manhattan’s upscale Upper East Side.

Bankers and others in New York, the nation’s financial capital, had expressed concern about Mamdani, but since his election many have explored how to work with him.",Other,0.0091916392882112,{'Other': 0.0},0,Other,Other,0.05,0.73,0.3,"Newly-elected New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist, aims to make the city more affordable for working people, potentially influencing the upcoming midterm elections and dividing national opinions along partisan lines."

According to figures released on Friday, the company delivered 418,227 vehicles versus the company-compiled consensus estimate of 422,850 and the Bloomberg consensus estimate of 440,907.

Tesla produced 434,358 vehicles during the quarter, down 5.5% year-on-year and below the 470,780 Bloomberg consensus estimate.

Deliveries were down 16% from the same period a year earlier.

Model 3 and Model Y deliveries totaled 406,585. This represents a 14% year-over-year decrease, missing the Bloomberg consensus estimate of 421,796 units.

Production of those models totaled 422,652, down 3.2% from last year.

Earlier on Friday, data from automotive industry organizations showed that Tesla registrations in Portugal, France, Sweden, and Spain had declined but they rose strongly in Norway.

Following the report, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note that the Q4 deliveries were ""better than whisper numbers"" and ""all eyes are on AI into 2026.""

""This will be viewed as better than feared deliveries and a step in the right direction for the Tesla story heading into 2026,"" wrote Ives. However, he also noted that ""Europe remains a continuous headwind.""

Taking a positive view on the company’s outlook, the analyst believes ""Tesla will own ~70% of the global autonomous market over the next decade as no other company in the world can match the scale and scope of Tesla coupled with its broadening AI footprint.""

Meanwhile, Truist analyst William Stein noted the deliveries came in below expectations, adding that Tesla also ""offered no updates on the more important topics: AI projects & new Vehicles.""

""We assert investors should be more focused on AI projects, especially FSD,"" said Stein. ""We view AI developments as far more important than auto deliveries for TSLA’s long-term cash generation and stock performance.

Jan 2 (Reuters) - European stocks kicked off 2026 by scaling record highs on Friday, extending 2025’s standout rally as tech and defence shares powered the gains.

The pan-European STOXX 600 rose 0.7% to 596.14, just four points away from the closely watched 600-mark, as traders returned from New Year celebrations. The index also notched its third straight weekly advance.

The benchmark wrapped up 2025 with its strongest performance since 2021, buoyed by falling interest rates, German fiscal stimulus and a rotation away from high-flying U.S. tech stocks with stretched valuations.

It was a year that tested investors, too. Markets absorbed tariff shocks and rebounded from April’s lows after U.S. President Donald Trump announced blanket tariffs on trading partners, rattling global risk appetite.

On Friday, London’s blue-chip FTSE 100 index hit the symbolic 10,000-point marker for the first time.

""From a logical point of view, a milestone of 10,000 is not important, but psychologically it is, as what we are seeing is that investors are keen to put money into the market without the fear of record highs,"" said Nick Saunders, CEO of trading platform Webull UK.

Bourses across the region ended the week higher. The German index ticked up 0.2%, France’s CAC 40 added 0.6%, while the FTSE 100 rose 0.2%.

Within the STOXX 600, ASML jumped 7%, driving gains in peers and the technology sub-sector. Defence stocks gained the most, advancing 3.3%.

Basic resources shares were up 0.6%, while the energy index rose 1.4%, tracking strength in precious metals and crude prices on the day. [GOL/][MET/L]

""Europe has mostly held on to its gains. There’s not a lot of individual news, but in general, it tells us the momentum and positivity towards European shares continue and that’s a good sign.

Among the laggards, media stocks dipped the most, falling 1.2%, continuing last year’s underperformance.

Real estate shares dropped 0.7%.

In other moves, shares of Orsted rose 4.6% after the Danish offshore wind developer said it was challenging the U.S. government’s suspension of its $5 billion Revolution Wind project lease.

In a report titled ""Sutskever’s Fate, OpenAI’s Next Deal, A Hit Robot—and 13 Other Predictions for 2026,"" The Information’s reporter Ann Gehan suggested that OpenAI would make Pinterest its ""biggest acquisition yet"" to strengthen its online shopping and advertising businesses.

According to Gehan, OpenAI would be primarily interested in Pinterest’s image data repository, existing advertising infrastructure, and established merchant relationships. She noted that Pinterest’s digital scrapbooking features could complement OpenAI’s image and video generation tools while helping it compete against other AI leaders like Google.

The report pointed out that Pinterest shares are trading around $25, similar to early 2023 levels, giving the company a market capitalization of approximately $17.5 billion. It also highlighted that Pinterest co-founders Ben Silbermann and Paul Sciarra control roughly two-thirds of the company’s voting shares, with Silbermann no longer involved in day-to-day operations since stepping down as CEO in mid-2022.

While Pinterest has implemented AI features like conversational search to compete with ChatGPT and similar platforms, the prediction suggests OpenAI might see more value in acquiring the company outright rather than competing against it.",Communication Services,0.0523128960377428,"{'Communication Services': 0.05231, 'Technology': 0.02272}",2,,"Communication Services, Technology",0.75,0.7,0.75,Pinterest's stock increased by 3% following a prediction by The Information that OpenAI intends to acquire the social media platform in 2026 to bolster its AI capabilities and online commerce presence.

The positive momentum came after analyst Chris Raymond noted price increases for both of Ardelyx’s key products, Xphozah and Ibsrela, effective January 1, 2026, according to PriceRx data. The price hikes appear more aggressive than previous adjustments, with Ibsrela increasing 9% compared to 5% last year, while Xphozah will see an 8% increase versus 7% previously.

Raymond James recently raised estimates for both medications following positive survey feedback indicating increasing usage patterns. While the impact on net pricing remains uncertain, the analyst believes these price adjustments provide additional support for the firm’s bullish commercial outlook on Ardelyx.

The price target of $16 represents significant potential upside from current levels for the kidney and gastrointestinal disease-focused company.

However, while European indices closed the day higher, they pulled back from their highs.

The STOXX 600 rose 0.6%, while Britain’s FTSE 100 closed up 0.2%, easing to 9,951.14 points after briefly topping the 10,000 mark. Germany’s DAX advanced 0.1%, and France’s CAC 40 gained 0.6%.

However, the eurozone manufacturing sector faced challenges at the end of 2025, with production levels decreasing for the first time since February. According to HCOB PMI data released Friday, the Eurozone Manufacturing PMI fell to 48.8 in December from 49.6 in November, hitting a nine-month low and signaling worsening factory conditions.

In the UK, house prices unexpectedly dropped 0.4% in December, resulting in just 0.6% annual growth for 2025 - the weakest yearly increase since April 2024, Nationwide Building Society reported.

Economists had expected a 0.1% monthly rise and 1.2% year-over-year growth. This marked a significant slowdown from November, when prices had risen 0.3% month-on-month and were 1.8% higher than a year earlier.

UK manufacturing expanded for a second month in December, with the PMI at a 15-month high of 50.6, driven by higher output, new domestic orders, and inventory building, mainly among large firms.

However, exports and employment continued to fall, costs rose, and business confidence weakened, casting doubt on the durability of the recovery.

Euro area money supply growth picked up in November, with M3 rising 3% and M1 remaining the main driver, while short-term deposits fell slightly.

Bank lending to households and non-financial corporations also increased, with annual growth rates of 2.9% and 3.1%, supporting broader credit expansion.

In renewable energy news, Revolution Wind LLC filed a supplemental complaint Thursday challenging a lease suspension order from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.

The company expects LINZESS U.S. net sales to reach between $1.125 billion and $1.175 billion in 2026, a substantial increase from its 2025 guidance of $860-$890 million. The projected growth is attributed to improved net pricing and low-single digit percentage demand growth, following a strategic list price reduction effective January 1, 2026.

Total revenue for 2026 is forecast to be between $450 million and $475 million, up from the 2025 guidance of $290-$310 million. Additionally, Ironwood anticipates adjusted EBITDA to exceed $300 million in 2026, more than double its 2025 projection of over $135 million.

""We remain focused on our core priorities of maximizing LINZESS, advancing apraglutide and delivering sustained profits and cash flows,"" said Tom McCourt, chief executive officer of Ironwood. The company indicated it ended the fourth quarter of 2025 with over $200 million in cash and cash equivalents.

Ironwood also reported progress on its pipeline, noting plans to initiate a confirmatory Phase 3 trial of apraglutide for the treatment of short bowel syndrome with intestinal failure in the first half of 2026.

2,2026-01-02 16:30:51,Reuters,Rivian’s 2025 deliveries slip below expectations as EV demand pressure persists,https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/rivians-2025-deliveries-slip-below-expectations-as-ev-demand-pressure-persists-4427732,"Jan 2 (Reuters) - Rivian on Friday reported 2025 electric vehicle deliveries that fell slightly more than expected, underscoring the pressure on demand for higher-priced EVs as it prepares to start delivering a lower-cost model in the first half of 2026.

The tally could leave investors focused on the pace of demand as Rivian seeks to improve profitability on the sale of vehicles.

The company has been pushing through efficiency measures at its Illinois plant and is simplifying components to cut material and manufacturing costs as it tries to narrow losses without relying solely on volume growth.

Rivian delivered 42,247 vehicles in 2025, down about 18% from a year earlier. Analysts had expected 42,500 deliveries for the year, according to Visible Alpha data — the average consensus implied a roughly 17.6% decline.

Automakers have been contending with slowing EV demand as the expiry of a $7,500 tax credit in the U.S. at the end of September resulted in higher prices.

For Rivian, which sells the R1T pickup truck and R1S SUV at premium price points, the environment has amplified scrutiny of whether demand can remain resilient while the company scales production.

Investors are looking ahead to Rivian’s smaller, lower-priced R2 SUV, which is expected to compete with Tesla’s best-selling Model Y.

For the fourth quarter ended December 31, Rivian produced 10,974 vehicles at its Normal, Illinois manufacturing facility and delivered 9,745. Wall Street had expected 10,050 deliveries in the quarter.

The company said it will release fourth-quarter and full-year 2025 financial results on February 12, after markets close.",Consumer Cyclical,0.0379015763409203,"{'Consumer Cyclical': 0.0379, 'Financials': 0.02317}",2,,"Consumer Cyclical, Financials",-0.6,-0.6,-0.7,"Rivian reported lower-than-expected 2025 electric vehicle deliveries, reflecting ongoing pressure on demand for high-priced EVs, despite efforts to improve efficiency and reduce costs."
